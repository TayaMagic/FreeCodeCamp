          <h2>Who is Bugs Bunny, Do you know him?</h2>
          <p>Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character created in the late 1930s by Leon Schlesinger Productions <i>(later Warner Bros. Cartoons)</i> and voiced originally by Mel Blanc. Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros. </p>
          <p>Though a similar character first appeared in the WB cartoon Porky's Hare Hunt in 1938 and a few subsequent shorts, the definitive characterization of Bugs Bunny is widely credited to have debuted in director Tex Avery's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare in 1940.</p>
          <p>Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catch phrase <b>"Eh...What's up, doc?"</b>.</p> 
          <p>Due to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment, but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world. He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos.</p>
